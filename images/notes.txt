Got it! Since your team is focused on providing AI as a service, your primary role will be to build and manage a scalable, self-service AI platform for developer teams across the bank. Here’s a refined breakdown:

1. AI Infrastructure & Compute Services
	•	GPU as a Service on OCP (Run:AI, NVIDIA GPU Operator, or OpenShift AI)
	•	Distributed Training & Inference (Ray, MPI, Kubernetes-native batch workloads)
	•	Auto-scaling & Cost Optimization (spot instances, GPU sharing, and resource quotas)
	•	LLM Hosting & Fine-tuning (Model registry, efficient finetuning with LoRA, PEFT)

2. Model Lifecycle Management (MLOps as a Service)
	•	Model Registry (MLflow, Vertex AI Model Registry, or OpenShift AI ModelMesh)
	•	CI/CD for Models (Tekton/ArgoCD for automated deployments)
	•	Feature Store as a Service (Feast, Databricks Feature Store)
	•	Data Versioning & Lineage (DVC, LakeFS, Delta Lake)

3. AI Model Serving & API Gateway
	•	Multi-Model Serving (KServe, NVIDIA Triton, TorchServe)
	•	Self-Service API Endpoints for Developers (FastAPI, OpenShift Service Mesh, Kong API Gateway)
	•	Inference Optimization (TensorRT, ONNX Runtime for model compression & acceleration)

4. AI Governance, Security, & Compliance
	•	Access Controls & Multi-Tenancy (OPA/Gatekeeper for policy enforcement)
	•	Explainability & Bias Detection (SHAP, Fairlearn, AI Fairness 360)
	•	Model Monitoring for Drift & Performance (Prometheus + Grafana for dashboards)
	•	Regulatory Compliance (SOC2, GDPR, CCAR, Basel II/III)

5. AI Developer Experience & Enablement
	•	Self-Service Portal for AI Services (Backstage for developer onboarding, AI SDKs)
	•	Pre-Trained Models & Templates (Curated foundation models, domain-specific models)
	•	ChatOps & AI Support Bots (LLM-powered assistant for Dev teams using Slack/MS Teams)

Key Sub-Teams You Might Need:
	1.	AI Platform Team – Owns infrastructure, GPUs, and OpenShift AI services.
	2.	MLOps & Deployment Team – Builds CI/CD pipelines, model registry, and feature store.
	3.	Model Governance Team – Handles compliance, security, and model risk management.
	4.	AI Developer Relations & Enablement – Creates SDKs, docs, and supports dev teams.
